### Web Server
* Servers serve resources: videos, photos, files
* Database servers, DNS servers, CDN servers
* Web server communicates via HTTP/HTTPS
* We need to know where the request is being made to: ip and port
* Every request needs two things: 1) url 2) method/verb
* GET /users, POST /tweets
* Choose a port: 65,535 to choose from
* Request and response
